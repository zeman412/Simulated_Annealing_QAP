# Implementation of Simulated Annealing Algorith to solve the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).
This code is an implementation of genetic algorithm to solve the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) test problems 
of Nugent et al (8 department). The objective is to minimize flow costs between the placed departments. The 
flow cost is (flow * distance), where both flow and distance are symmetric between any given pair of departments. 

The optimal flow cost is 107 (or 214 for double flows), with solution vector of [6 7 8 3 5 4 1 2].
